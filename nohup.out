Hmm, at first glance, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down.\n\nOkay, so f(x) is defined as x multiplied by (-1/2) plus x multiplied by (1/2). So, f(x) = x*(-1/2) + x*(1/2). I think I can simplify this expression. Maybe I can factor out the x since it\'s common to both terms. So, f(x) = x*(-1/2 + 1/2). Now, inside the parentheses, -1/2 plus 1/2 should cancel each other out, right? Because they\'re additive inverses. So, that would leave me with f(x) = x*0, which is just 0. So, f(x) = 0 for all x. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but the problem says to prove that f(x) is equal to zero for all x. I guess I just did that by simplifying the expression. But maybe I should be more rigorous. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I plug in some values for x to see if it holds true.\n\nLet\'s try x = 0. Then f(0) = 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/2) = 0 + 0 = 0. Okay, that works. How about x = 2? f(2) = 2*(-1/2) + 2*(1/2) = -1 + 1 = 0. Hmm, that\'s zero too. What if x = -3? f(-3) = -3*(-1/2) + (-3)*(1/2) = 1.5 - 1.5 = 0. Still zero. So, it seems like no matter what x I choose, f(x) is always zero.\n\nBut is there a more general way to show this without plugging in specific values? Maybe by using algebraic properties. Let\'s see. Starting with f(x) = x*(-1/2) + x*(1/2). I can factor out the x, as I did before, to get f(x) = x*(-1/2 + 1/2). Now, -1/2 + 1/2 is zero, so f(x) = x*0 = 0. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI guess the key idea here is that when you have two terms with the same variable multiplied by coefficients that are additive inverses, they cancel each other out, resulting in zero. So, f(x) is identically zero for all x.\n\nBut wait, what if x is not a number? Like, what if x is a vector or something more complicated? The problem doesn\'t specify, but I think it\'s safe to assume that x is a real number since we\'re dealing with fractions like 1/2 and -1/2.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any special cases where this might not hold true. For example, what if x is infinity? Well, in standard real numbers, infinity isn\'t a number, so that\'s probably outside the scope of this problem. Similarly, if x is approaching zero, f(x) still approaches zero, which aligns with our previous calculations.\n\nAnother thing to think about is the behavior of the function as x changes. Since f(x) is always zero, the graph of this function would be the x-axis itself. There\'s no slope, no curvature, just a straight line along y = 0. That visual makes sense with the algebraic result.\n\nI also wonder if there\'s a geometric interpretation of this function. If f(x) represents some kind of transformation or movement, does it make sense that it results in zero for all x? Maybe in a vector space, if you have two vectors that are negatives of each other, their sum would be zero. But again, the problem doesn\'t specify the context, so I\'ll stick to the algebraic proof.\n\nIn summary, by simplifying the expression f(x) = x*(-1/2) + x*(1/2), we factor out the x and see that the coefficients cancel each other out, leaving f(x) = 0 for all x. Additionally, testing with specific values of x confirms that the function always equals zero. Therefore, the proof is complete.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let\'s provide a clear step-by-step explanation and proof for the statement.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**\n\nWe are given the function:\n\\[ f(x) = x \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\', "Alright, so I'm trying to understand this problem. It says that for any positive integer \\( a \\), if there are positive integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that \\( x^2 > a \\) and \\( y^2 - a = x \\), then this equation has infinitely many solutions. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what's being asked. We have \\( a \\) as a positive integer, and we're looking for positive integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) where \\( x^2 \\) is greater than \\( a \\), and when you take \\( y^2 \\) and subtract \\( a \\), you get \\( x \\). So, \\( y^2 - a = x \\), and \\( x^2 > a \\).\n\nI think the first step is to see if I can find any solutions for a specific value of \\( a \\). Let's pick a small \\( a \\), say \\( a = 1 \\). Then, \\( x^2 > 1 \\) implies \\( x \\geq 2 \\). Now, \\( y^2 - 1 = x \\), so \\( y^2 = x + 1 \\). For \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y^2 = 3 \\), but 3 isn't a perfect square, so no solution there. For \\( x = 3 \\), \\( y^2 = 4 \\), which means \\( y = 2 \\). So, \\( (x, y) = (3, 2) \\) is a solution. \n\nWait, but the problem says there are infinitely many solutions. So, maybe for \\( a = 1 \\), there's only one solution? Or maybe I'm missing something. Let's try \\( x = 4 \\). Then \\( y^2 = 5 \\), which isn't a perfect square. \\( x = 5 \\), \\( y^2 = 6 \\), not a perfect square. \\( x = 6 \\), \\( y^2 = 7 \\), nope. \\( x = 7 \\), \\( y^2 = 8 \\), nope. \\( x = 8 \\), \\( y^2 = 9 \\), which means \\( y = 3 \\). So, \\( (8, 3) \\) is another solution. \n\nOkay, so for \\( a = 1 \\), I have at least two solutions: \\( (3, 2) \\) and \\( (8, 3) \\). Maybe there's a pattern here. Let's see if I can find more solutions. \\( x = 15 \\), \\( y^2 = 16 \\), so \\( y = 4 \\). So, \\( (15, 4) \\) is another solution. It seems like the solutions are increasing, and perhaps there's a way to generate infinitely many of them.\n\nBut how? Maybe there's a recursive relationship or some formula that can generate the next solution from the previous one. Let's see. From \\( (3, 2) \\) to \\( (8, 3) \\), the \\( x \\) value increases by 5, and the \\( y \\) value increases by 1. From \\( (8, 3) \\) to \\( (15, 4) \\), \\( x \\) increases by 7, and \\( y \\) increases by 1 again. Hmm, the differences between the \\( x \\) values are increasing by 2 each time. Maybe this pattern continues.\n\nIf that's the case, then I can keep generating larger \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) values that satisfy the equation, leading to infinitely many solutions. But I need to make sure this pattern holds. Let's try the next one. If the last \\( x \\) was 15, adding 9 (since the difference increased by 2) would give \\( x = 24 \\). Then \\( y^2 = 24 + 1 = 25 \\), so \\( y = 5 \\). So, \\( (24, 5) \\) is another solution. This seems to confirm the pattern.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is rigorous enough. Maybe I need to find a general formula or a way to express \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in terms of some parameter that can take infinitely many values. Let's think about it differently. Suppose I set \\( y = k \\), then \\( x = k^2 - a \\). But we also have \\( x^2 > a \\), so \\( (k^2 - a)^2 > a \\). This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nPerhaps I can", "Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The problem involves several angles: 45°, 60°, 75°, and so on. I'm not entirely sure what the goal is, but I think it's to find some relationship or measure between these angles, maybe in a triangle or some polygon.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize what's going on. If I imagine a triangle with angles 45°, 60°, and 75°, that adds up to 180°, which makes sense for a triangle. But I'm not sure if that's the right path. Maybe it's about multiple triangles or some other geometric shape.\n\nI recall that in geometry, when you have angles that add up in specific ways, you can use properties of triangles, parallel lines, or even circles to find relationships. For example, if two angles are equal, their sides might be proportional, or if angles are supplementary, their sides might form straight lines.\n\nLet me think about the angles given: 45°, 60°, and 75°. These are all multiples of 15°, which might hint at some special triangles or properties. I know that 45° is a common angle in isosceles right triangles, and 60° is part of equilateral triangles. 75° is a bit less common, but it can be thought of as 30° + 45°, which might help in breaking it down.\n\nMaybe I should try drawing a diagram to see if these angles fit into a particular configuration. If I draw a triangle with one angle being 45°, another being 60°, and the third being 75°, that should work since they add up to 180°. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem involves more than one triangle. Maybe there's a larger figure where these angles are parts of different triangles, and I need to find a specific angle or side length. If that's the case, I might need to use theorems like the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines to relate the sides and angles.\n\nI also remember that sometimes, in geometry problems, you can use the concept of similar triangles or congruent triangles to find unknown measures. If I can identify similar triangles in the figure, I can set up proportions to solve for missing angles or sides.\n\nAnother approach could be to look for cyclic quadrilaterals or other polygons where the sum of interior angles has a specific formula. For example, in a quadrilateral, the sum of the interior angles is 360°, so if I have some angles given, I can find the missing ones.\n\nI think I need to get back to the basics and see if there's a fundamental property or theorem that applies here. Maybe it's something about the sum of angles in a triangle, or perhaps it's about the exterior angles. Exterior angles are equal to the sum of the remote interior angles, which might be useful if I'm dealing with a transversal cutting across parallel lines.\n\nWait, I also recall that in some cases, especially with polygons, the exterior angles add up to 360°, regardless of the number of sides. So if I'm dealing with a polygon and I know some of the exterior angles, I can find the missing ones by subtracting from 360°.\n\nBut I'm still not sure how this connects to the angles given: 45°, 60°, and 75°. Maybe I need to think about how these angles relate to each other in terms of being complementary or supplementary. For example, 45° and 60° add up to 105°, which isn't a standard angle, but 45° and 75° add up to 120°, which is a nice angle in its own right.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if these angles are part of a right triangle. A 45°-45°-90° triangle is a right triangle with two equal angles, and a 30°-60°-90° triangle has angles that are multiples of 30°, which might relate to the 60° angle here. But I'm not sure how the 75° angle fits into this.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the problem involves angle bisectors or medians. If I can identify where the bisectors are, I might be able to find some relationships between the angles. For example, an angle bisector divides an angle into two equal parts, so if I have a 75° angle and it's bisected, each part would be", 'Alright, so I\'ve got this math problem here that I need to solve. It says, "Prove that if \\( abc = 0 \\), then \\( abc - acb = 0 \\)." Hmm, at first glance, it seems pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand what\'s being asked and how to approach it.\n\nOkay, so let\'s break it down. We\'re given that the product of three elements \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) is zero. That is, \\( abc = 0 \\). And we need to show that \\( abc - acb = 0 \\). So, essentially, we\'re being asked to prove that swapping the positions of \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) in the product doesn\'t change the value of the product, given that the original product is zero.\n\nWait a minute, is this always true? I mean, in regular arithmetic, multiplication is commutative, so \\( abc \\) should be the same as \\( acb \\). But the problem specifies that \\( abc = 0 \\). Does that affect anything? Maybe in some algebraic structures, multiplication isn\'t commutative, but in standard arithmetic or in a commutative ring, it should hold.\n\nLet me think about this. In a commutative ring, \\( ab = ba \\) for any elements \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). So, if \\( abc = 0 \\), then \\( acb \\) should also be zero because \\( acb = a(cb) = a(bc) = abc = 0 \\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nIf \\( abc = 0 \\), then \\( acb = a(cb) \\). But since multiplication is commutative, \\( cb = bc \\), so \\( acb = a(bc) = abc = 0 \\). Yeah, that seems to make sense. So, in a commutative ring, \\( abc - acb = 0 - 0 = 0 \\), which is what we need to prove.\n\nBut what if we\'re not in a commutative ring? The problem doesn\'t specify, but I think it\'s safe to assume we\'re working in a commutative setting unless stated otherwise. Plus, the problem seems to be framed in a way that suggests commutativity is involved.\n\nOkay, so to summarize my thoughts: Given that \\( abc = 0 \\), and assuming that multiplication is commutative, swapping \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) in the product \\( abc \\) gives \\( acb \\), which should also be zero. Therefore, \\( abc - acb = 0 - 0 = 0 \\), which proves the statement.\n\nI think that covers it. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any edge cases or specific scenarios where this might not hold. For example, what if \\( a \\), \\( b \\), or \\( c \\) are zero elements? Well, if any of them are zero, then \\( abc = 0 \\) by definition, and \\( acb \\) would also be zero because multiplying by zero gives zero. So, the difference \\( abc - acb \\) would still be zero.\n\nWhat if \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are all non-zero? Well, in a commutative ring, even if individual elements are non-zero, their product could still be zero if the ring has zero divisors. But regardless, the commutativity ensures that swapping \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) doesn\'t change the product\'s value, so \\( abc - acb \\) remains zero.\n\nAlright, I think I\'ve covered the bases. The key point is the commutativity of multiplication, which allows us to swap \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) without changing the product\'s value, leading to \\( abc - acb = 0 \\).\n</think>\n\nNow, let\'s provide a clear step-by-step explanation and proof for the statement.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nGiven that \\( abc = 0 \\), we aim to show that \\( abc - acb = 0 \\).\n\n1. **Start with the given equation:**\n   \\[\n   abc = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express \\( acb \\) using the commutative property of multiplication:**\n   Since multiplication is commutative (\\( bc = cb \\)),\n   \\[\n   acb = a(cb) = a(bc) = abc\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the given value of \\( abc \\) into the expression for \\( acb \\):**\n   \\[\n   acb = abc = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the difference \\( abc - acb \\):**\n   \\[\n   abc - acb = 0 -', "Alright, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It looks like it's about logarithms and exponents, which I remember from my algebra class, but I'm not entirely confident about all the properties. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are these four expressions:\n\n1. \\( a(x - y) = ax - ay \\)\n2. \\( a^{x - y} = \\frac{a^x}{a^y} \\)\n3. \\( \\log(x - y) = \\log x - \\log y \\)\n4. \\( x - y > 0 \\)\n\nAnd I need to prove that all these statements are true given that \\( a > 0 \\), \\( x > 0 \\), and \\( y > 0 \\).\n\nOkay, starting with the first one: \\( a(x - y) = ax - ay \\). This looks like the distributive property, where multiplication distributes over subtraction. I think that's correct because when you distribute \\( a \\) over \\( x - y \\), you multiply \\( a \\) by both \\( x \\) and \\( -y \\), which gives \\( ax - ay \\). So, that one makes sense.\n\nNext up is \\( a^{x - y} = \\frac{a^x}{a^y} \\). I recall that when you subtract exponents with the same base, you divide the quantities. So, \\( a^{x - y} \\) should indeed be equal to \\( \\frac{a^x}{a^y} \\). I think that's right, but maybe I should double-check the exponent rules to be sure.\n\nThen there's \\( \\log(x - y) = \\log x - \\log y \\). Hmm, this one seems a bit trickier. I know that logarithms have properties related to multiplication and division, like \\( \\log(xy) = \\log x + \\log y \\) and \\( \\log\\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right) = \\log x - \\log y \\). But here, it's \\( \\log(x - y) \\), which is subtraction inside the logarithm. I don't think there's a direct property for that. Maybe this one isn't always true, or perhaps it's only under certain conditions. I need to think about this more carefully.\n\nFinally, \\( x - y > 0 \\). This just means that \\( x \\) is greater than \\( y \\). Given that \\( x > 0 \\) and \\( y > 0 \\), it's possible for \\( x - y \\) to be positive or negative depending on the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). So, I guess this condition is ensuring that \\( x - y \\) is positive, which might be important for the other equations to hold.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to make sure that all these equations are valid under the given conditions. For the first two, I'm pretty confident based on the properties I remember. The third one, though, I'm not so sure about. Maybe I should look up the logarithm properties again to confirm if \\( \\log(x - y) = \\log x - \\log y \\) is actually a valid identity.\n\nAfter double-checking, I realize that \\( \\log(x - y) \\) isn't generally equal to \\( \\log x - \\log y \\). The correct property is \\( \\log\\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right) = \\log x - \\log y \\). So, it seems like there might be a mistake in the original statement. Maybe it was supposed to be \\( \\log\\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right) \\) instead of \\( \\log(x - y) \\).\n\nAssuming that the third equation is supposed to be \\( \\log\\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right) = \\log x - \\log y \\), then that would make sense based on the logarithm division rule. But as it stands, \\( \\log(x - y) = \\log x - \\log y \\) isn't generally true. So, I need to either correct that equation or note that it's not valid.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the assumption that the third equation is incorrect and should be \\( \\log\\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right) = \\log x - \\log y \\). This way, all four equations would align with the standard logarithm and exponent properties.\n\nSo, to summarize my thoughts:\n\n1. \\( a(x - y) = ax - ay \\) is correct by the distributive property.\n2. \\( a^{x - y} = \\frac{a^x}{a^y} \\) is correct by the exponent subtraction rule.\n3. \\( \\log(x - y) =", "Alright, so I've got this equation here: 12 times 60 over 100 times x equals 60 times 40 over 100 times 12. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to break it down and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, I see that both sides of the equation have similar numbers: 12, 60, and 40, all multiplied by 100. Maybe there's a pattern or a simplification I can use here. I'm thinking that perhaps I can simplify the equation by canceling out some of these numbers to make it easier to solve for x.\n\nOkay, so let's write out the equation again to make it clearer:\n\n(12 * 60 / 100) * x = (60 * 40 / 100) * 12\n\nHmm, I notice that both sides have a multiplication by 12. Maybe I can divide both sides by 12 to simplify things. Let's try that:\n\n(12 * 60 / 100) * x / 12 = (60 * 40 / 100) * 12 / 12\n\nOn the left side, the 12 in the numerator and the 12 in the denominator cancel each other out, leaving me with:\n\n(60 / 100) * x = (60 * 40 / 100)\n\nOkay, that's a bit simpler. Now, I see that both sides have a multiplication by 60 and 100. Maybe I can divide both sides by 60 to further simplify:\n\n(60 / 100) * x / 60 = (60 * 40 / 100) / 60\n\nOn the left side, the 60 in the numerator and the 60 in the denominator cancel out, leaving me with:\n\nx / 100 = (60 * 40 / 100) / 60\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that step. I think I might have made a mistake in dividing both sides by 60. Let me try that again.\n\nStarting from:\n\n(60 / 100) * x = (60 * 40 / 100)\n\nIf I divide both sides by 60, I should get:\n\n(60 / 100) * x / 60 = (60 * 40 / 100) / 60\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx / 100 = (60 * 40 / 100) / 60\n\nBut actually, dividing both sides by 60 should cancel out the 60 on the left side, leaving me with:\n\nx / 100 = (60 * 40 / 100) / 60\n\nHmm, that still seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let me think differently.\n\nWhat if I first simplify both sides of the equation separately before trying to solve for x? Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the left side:\n\n12 * 60 / 100 * x\n\nI can calculate 12 * 60 first, which is 720. So, it becomes:\n\n720 / 100 * x\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n7.2 * x\n\nOkay, that's simpler. Now, the right side:\n\n60 * 40 / 100 * 12\n\nFirst, 60 * 40 is 2400. So, it becomes:\n\n2400 / 100 * 12\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n24 * 12\n\nAnd 24 * 12 is 288.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\n7.2 * x = 288\n\nAlright, that's much easier to work with. Now, to solve for x, I just need to divide both sides by 7.2.\n\nSo:\n\nx = 288 / 7.2\n\nLet me do that division. 288 divided by 7.2.\n\nWell, 7.2 times 40 is 288, because 7.2 * 40 = 288.\n\nSo, x = 40.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Did I miss something? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I simplified both", 'Alright, so I\'ve got this math problem here that I need to solve. It says, "Prove that if \\( d^2 / 2 = 40 \\), then \\( d^2 = 80 \\)." Hmm, at first glance, it seems pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand every step clearly.\n\nOkay, so starting with the given equation: \\( \\frac{d^2}{2} = 40 \\). I need to find \\( d^2 \\) and show that it equals 80. That seems simple enough, but I guess I should think about why this works and how to formally prove it.\n\nFirst, I recall that if I have an equation like \\( \\frac{x}{a} = b \\), to solve for \\( x \\), I can multiply both sides by \\( a \\). So applying that here, if I multiply both sides of \\( \\frac{d^2}{2} = 40 \\) by 2, I should get \\( d^2 = 80 \\). That makes sense, but I want to make sure I\'m not missing anything.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if \\( d^2 \\) is positive. Since \\( d^2 \\) is always non-negative, and 40 is positive, then \\( d^2 \\) must be positive as well. So multiplying both sides by 2 won\'t change the equality, and I won\'t introduce any extraneous solutions or anything like that.\n\nBut what if \\( d \\) is zero? Well, if \\( d = 0 \\), then \\( d^2 = 0 \\), and \\( \\frac{0}{2} = 0 \\), which doesn\'t equal 40. So \\( d \\) can\'t be zero in this case. That\'s good to know.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any restrictions on \\( d \\). The problem doesn\'t specify, but since we\'re dealing with real numbers, \\( d \\) can be any real number except zero, as we\'ve just determined.\n\nNow, to make this a formal proof, I should probably write it out step by step, showing the algebraic manipulation clearly. Maybe I should also state the properties I\'m using, like the multiplication property of equality, to make it more rigorous.\n\nLet me also think about if there\'s another way to approach this problem. For example, could I start by multiplying both sides by 2 first and then see what happens? Well, that\'s essentially the same as what I just did, but it\'s good to confirm.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any alternative interpretations of the equation. For instance, could \\( d^2 / 2 \\) be interpreted differently? I don\'t think so, because division by 2 is straightforward here.\n\nI also wonder if there\'s a geometric interpretation of this equation. If \\( d^2 \\) represents the area of a square with side length \\( d \\), then \\( \\frac{d^2}{2} \\) would be half of that area. Setting that equal to 40 means that half the area of the square is 40, so the full area would be 80. That makes sense and aligns with the algebraic solution.\n\nBut since the problem is purely algebraic, I think focusing on the algebraic manipulation is sufficient for the proof.\n\nAlright, so to summarize my thoughts:\n\n1. Start with the given equation: \\( \\frac{d^2}{2} = 40 \\).\n2. Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \\( d^2 \\).\n3. Show that \\( d^2 = 80 \\).\n4. Confirm that \\( d \\) cannot be zero.\n5. Consider if there are any alternative interpretations or methods, but stick to the algebraic approach for clarity and rigor.\n\nNow, I\'ll try to write out the proof step by step, making sure to explain each part clearly.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that if \\( \\frac{d^2}{2} = 40 \\), then \\( d^2 = 80 \\), follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Start with the given equation**\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2}{2} = 40\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the denominator**\n\\[\n2 \\times \\frac{d^2}{2} = 2 \\times 40\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify both sides of the equation**\n\\[\nd^2 = 80\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, if \\( \\frac{d^2}{2} = 40 \\), then \\( d^2 = 80 \\).\n\n```lean4\ntheorem thm_268', 'Alright, so I\'ve got this math problem here, and I need to finish the proof. Let me try to understand what\'s going on. The problem states that if a + h > b + k and a + h = b + k, then we should conclude that a = b and h = k. Hmm, that seems a bit contradictory at first glance because if a + h is both greater than and equal to b + k, that doesn\'t make sense unless those inequalities are somehow not strict. Maybe there\'s a typo or something missing in the problem statement.\n\nLet me think about this. If a + h is greater than b + k, and at the same time, a + h equals b + k, that\'s like saying something is both greater than and equal to another thing, which doesn\'t make sense unless we\'re dealing with some kind of special cases or maybe it\'s a trick question. Perhaps the problem is trying to get me to recognize that these two conditions can\'t both be true unless certain conditions are met, like a = b and h = k.\n\nOkay, so maybe I need to assume that a + h > b + k and a + h = b + k are both true and see what that implies. If a + h is greater than b + k, and it\'s also equal to b + k, then that would mean that a + h is both greater than and equal to b + k, which is only possible if a + h equals b + k, and the inequality is somehow not strict. That seems a bit confusing.\n\nMaybe I should try to subtract the two equations or something like that. If a + h = b + k, then subtracting b + k from both sides gives me a + h - b - k = 0. That simplifies to (a - b) + (h - k) = 0. So, a - b = k - h. Hmm, interesting. So, the difference between a and b is equal to the difference between k and h.\n\nBut wait, the problem also says that a + h > b + k. If I rearrange that inequality, I get a - b > k - h. But from the equation, I have a - b = k - h. So, that would mean that a - b is both greater than and equal to k - h, which seems contradictory unless a - b equals k - h exactly. That would mean that a - b = k - h, and since a - b is also greater than or equal to k - h, the only way that can happen is if a - b equals k - h exactly.\n\nSo, from that, I can conclude that a - b = k - h, and since a + h = b + k, I can solve for a and b in terms of h and k. Let me try that. From a + h = b + k, I can write a = b + k - h. Then, substituting that into a - b = k - h, I get (b + k - h) - b = k - h, which simplifies to k - h = k - h. That\'s always true, so it doesn\'t give me any new information.\n\nMaybe I need to approach this differently. Perhaps I should consider specific values for a, b, h, and k to see if I can find a pattern or a contradiction. Let\'s say a = 2, b = 1, h = 3, and k = 2. Then a + h = 5, and b + k = 3, so a + h > b + k. But a + h = b + k is not true in this case, so this doesn\'t satisfy both conditions.\n\nWhat if a = b and h = k? Let\'s say a = b = 2 and h = k = 3. Then a + h = 5 and b + k = 5, so a + h = b + k. That satisfies the equality, but does it satisfy the inequality? No, because a + h is not greater than b + k, it\'s equal. So, in this case, both conditions are not met.\n\nWait, the problem says "if a + h > b + k and a + h = b + k," which seems impossible because a + h cannot be both greater than and equal to b + k at the same time. Maybe the problem is trying to get me to recognize that these two conditions are contradictory, and therefore, the only way both can be true is if a = b and h = k, which would make both a + h > b + k and a + h = b + k true in a trivial sense.\n\nBut that seems a bit forced. Maybe I\'m missing something. Perhaps there\'s a different interpretation of the inequalities or the variables involved. Maybe a', "Alright, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It looks a bit complicated at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step. The problem is about finding all pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that the expression (a/b) + (14b)/(9a) is between 0 and 30, inclusive. Additionally, it mentions that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b is 1, which I think means that a and b are coprime, or have no common factors other than 1.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what the expression (a/b) + (14b)/(9a) really means. It seems like it's a sum of two fractions, one involving a and b directly, and the other involving b squared over a. Since a and b are positive integers, both terms are positive, so the whole expression is definitely positive. That's good because the problem states that the expression is between 0 and 30, so the lower bound of 0 makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to find all pairs (a, b) where this expression is less than or equal to 30. That means I need to set up an inequality:\n\n(a/b) + (14b)/(9a) ≤ 30\n\nI think the first step is to simplify this expression or find a way to relate a and b. Maybe I can combine the two fractions into a single fraction to make it easier to handle. To do that, I need a common denominator, which would be 9ab. So, let's rewrite both terms with this denominator:\n\n(a/b) = (9a^2)/(9ab)\n(14b)/(9a) = (14b^2)/(9ab)\n\nSo, adding them together:\n\n(9a^2 + 14b^2)/(9ab) ≤ 30\n\nNow, to eliminate the denominator, I can multiply both sides of the inequality by 9ab, assuming a and b are positive, which they are. So:\n\n9a^2 + 14b^2 ≤ 270ab\n\nHmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe I can rearrange the terms to bring everything to one side:\n\n9a^2 - 270ab + 14b^2 ≤ 0\n\nThis is a quadratic inequality in terms of a, but it's a bit complicated because it involves both a and b. I'm not sure if this is the best approach. Maybe there's another way to handle this.\n\nAnother thought: since a and b are coprime, perhaps I can use that fact to simplify the problem. If gcd(a, b) = 1, then a and b share no common factors, which might help in reducing the expression or finding possible values of a and b.\n\nLet me think about possible values of a and b. Since a and b are positive integers, I can start by trying small values of a and b and see if they satisfy the inequality. For example, let's try a = 1 and b = 1:\n\n(1/1) + (14*1)/(9*1) = 1 + 14/9 ≈ 1 + 1.555... ≈ 2.555..., which is less than 30. So, (1, 1) is a valid pair.\n\nWhat about a = 2 and b = 1:\n\n(2/1) + (14*1)/(9*2) = 2 + 14/18 ≈ 2 + 0.777... ≈ 2.777..., still less than 30.\n\na = 3, b = 1:\n\n3 + 14/27 ≈ 3 + 0.518... ≈ 3.518..., also less than 30.\n\na = 4, b = 1:\n\n4 + 14/36 ≈ 4 + 0.388... ≈ 4.388..., still good.\n\na = 5, b = 1:\n\n5 + 14/45 ≈ 5 + 0.311... ≈ 5.311..., okay.\n\na = 6, b = 1:\n\n6 + 14/54 ≈ 6 + 0.259... ≈ 6.259..., still under 30.\n\na = 7, b = 1:\n\n7 + 14/63 ≈ 7 + 0.222... ≈ 7.2", "Alright, so I've got this problem here that I need to solve. It's about a sequence defined recursively, and I need to prove that a certain term in the sequence equals 7^11. The sequence is defined as follows: a_3 equals 3 squared, which is 9, and for every n greater than or equal to 4, a_n is equal to (n divided by (n minus 1)) raised to the power of (a_{n-1} divided by a_{n-2}).\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what this sequence is doing. Let's see, starting from a_3 = 9, then for a_4, it's (4/3) raised to the power of (a_3 / a_2). Wait, but a_2 isn't defined yet. Hmm, maybe I need to figure out what a_2 is. But the problem only gives me a_3. Maybe a_2 is just 2 squared, which is 4, following the pattern? That seems reasonable.\n\nSo, a_2 = 4, a_3 = 9. Then a_4 = (4/3)^(9/4). Let's calculate that. 9 divided by 4 is 2.25, so a_4 = (4/3)^2.25. That's approximately (1.3333)^2.25, which is roughly 1.3333 squared is about 1.7778, and then taking the square root of that, which is roughly 1.3333 again. So, a_4 is approximately 1.3333.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Maybe I should keep it exact instead of approximating. So, (4/3)^(9/4) can be written as (4/3)^(2 + 1/4) = (4/3)^2 * (4/3)^(1/4). (4/3)^2 is 16/9, and (4/3)^(1/4) is the fourth root of 4/3, which is approximately 1.0746. So, multiplying them gives roughly 16/9 * 1.0746 ≈ 1.7778 * 1.0746 ≈ 1.914.\n\nHmm, so a_4 is approximately 1.914. Okay, moving on to a_5. a_5 = (5/4)^(a_4 / a_3). So, a_4 / a_3 is approximately 1.914 / 9 ≈ 0.2127. So, a_5 = (5/4)^0.2127. 5/4 is 1.25, and 1.25^0.2127 is approximately 1.05.\n\nSo, a_5 is roughly 1.05. Then a_6 = (6/5)^(a_5 / a_4). a_5 / a_4 is approximately 1.05 / 1.914 ≈ 0.548. So, a_6 = (6/5)^0.548. 6/5 is 1.2, and 1.2^0.548 is approximately 1.09.\n\nContinuing this way, a_7 = (7/6)^(a_6 / a_5). a_6 / a_5 is approximately 1.09 / 1.05 ≈ 1.038. So, a_7 = (7/6)^1.038. 7/6 is approximately 1.1667, and 1.1667^1.038 is roughly 1.195.\n\na_8 = (8/7)^(a_7 / a_6). a_7 / a_6 is approximately 1.195 / 1.09 ≈ 1.096. So, a_8 = (8/7)^1.096. 8/7 is approximately 1.1429, and 1.1429^1.096 is roughly 1.22.\n\na_9 = (9/8)^(a_8 / a_7). a_8 / a_7 is approximately 1.22 / 1.195 ≈ 1.021"]

[36m(main_task pid=1641625)[0m ['Alright, so I\'ve got this math problem here that I need to solve. It says, "Prove that the function f(x) = x(-1/2) + x(1/2) is equal to zero for all x." Hmm, at first glance, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down.\n\nOkay, so f(x) is defined as x multiplied by (-1/2) plus x multiplied by (1/2). So, f(x) = x*(-1/2) + x*(1/2). I think I can simplify this expression. Maybe I can factor out the x since it\'s common to both terms. So, f(x) = x*(-1/2 + 1/2). Now, inside the parentheses, -1/2 plus 1/2 equals zero, right? So, f(x) = x*0. And anything multiplied by zero is zero. So, f(x) = 0.\n\nWait, but the problem says to prove that f(x) is equal to zero for all x. So, based on my calculation, it seems like f(x) is indeed zero for any value of x. But maybe I should double-check to make sure I didn\'t make any mistakes.\n\nLet me pick a specific value for x, say x = 2. Plugging into the original function: f(2) = 2*(-1/2) + 2*(1/2) = -1 + 1 = 0. Okay, that works. How about x = -3? f(-3) = (-3)*(-1/2) + (-3)*(1/2) = 1.5 - 1.5 = 0. Still zero. Maybe try x = 0. f(0) = 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/2) = 0 + 0 = 0. Yep, that\'s zero too.\n\nSo, it seems like no matter what x is, f(x) equals zero. But I should probably write this out more formally to make it a proper proof. Maybe I can start by stating that f(x) is defined as x*(-1/2) + x*(1/2), and then show the steps to simplify it to zero.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this in terms of combining like terms. Since both terms have x multiplied by a scalar, I can add the scalars together first and then multiply by x. So, -1/2 plus 1/2 is zero, and zero times x is zero. That would be a more algebraic way to show it.\n\nI also wonder if there\'s any geometric interpretation of this function. If f(x) is always zero, does that mean it\'s a constant function? Yes, it is. The graph of f(x) = 0 would be the x-axis itself, which makes sense because for every x, the output is zero.\n\nMaybe to make this even clearer, I can use the distributive property to factor out the x and show that the remaining factor is zero. So, f(x) = x*(-1/2 + 1/2) = x*0 = 0. That seems straightforward.\n\nI should also consider if there are any special cases or if x could be something other than a real number. But since the problem doesn\'t specify, I\'ll assume x is a real number. If x were a complex number, the same logic would apply because multiplication by zero is zero regardless of the number\'s type.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to recognize that f(x) is a linear combination of x with coefficients that sum to zero. So, (-1/2) + (1/2) = 0, which means the combination cancels out, leaving f(x) = 0.\n\nI think I\'ve covered the basic ways to approach this proof. It seems pretty straightforward, but it\'s always good to be thorough to avoid any mistakes. I\'ll make sure to present the steps clearly and logically to ensure that anyone reading the proof can follow along easily.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that the function \\( f(x) = x\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + x\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\) is equal to zero for all \\( x \\), follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Start with the given function.**\n\\[ f(x) = x\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + x\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\]\n\n**Step 2: Factor out the common term \\( x \\).**\n\\[ f(x) = x\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses.', "Alright, so I've got this problem here that I need to solve. It's about a sequence defined recursively, and I need to prove that a certain term in the sequence equals 7^11. The sequence is defined as follows: a_3 equals 3 squared, which is 9, and for every n greater than or equal to 4, a_n is equal to (n divided by (n minus 1)) raised to the power of (a_{n-1} divided by a_{n-2}).\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what this sequence is doing. Let's see, starting from a_3 = 9, then for a_4, it's (4/3) raised to the power of (a_3 / a_2). Wait, but a_2 isn't defined yet. Hmm, maybe I need to figure out what a_2 is. But the problem only gives me a_3. Maybe a_2 is just 2 squared, which is 4, following the pattern? That seems reasonable.\n\nSo, a_2 = 4, a_3 = 9. Then a_4 = (4/3)^(9/4). Let's calculate that. 9 divided by 4 is 2.25, so a_4 = (4/3)^2.25. That's approximately (1.3333)^2.25, which is roughly 1.3333 squared is about 1.7778, and then taking the square root of that, which would be around 1.3333 again. So, a_4 is approximately 1.3333.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Maybe I should keep it as fractions to be more precise. So, 4/3 raised to the power of 9/4. That's the same as (4/3)^(9/4). I can write that as (4^9)/(3^9) all raised to the 1/4 power, which is the fourth root of (4^9)/(3^9). That's a bit messy, but maybe it simplifies somehow.\n\nMoving on, a_5 would be (5/4) raised to the power of (a_4 / a_3). So, a_4 is (4/3)^(9/4), and a_3 is 9. So, a_4 / a_3 is ((4/3)^(9/4)) / 9. That's a bit complicated. Maybe there's a pattern here that I'm missing.\n\nI need to find a general formula for a_n, or at least find a way to compute a_2019. But computing up to a_2019 manually is impossible. There must be a pattern or a simplification that I can find.\n\nLet me try to compute a few more terms to see if a pattern emerges. a_4 is (4/3)^(9/4), a_5 is (5/4)^(a_4 / a_3), which is (5/4)^( (4/3)^(9/4) / 9 ). That's getting really complicated. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.\n\nPerhaps there's a way to express a_n in terms of factorials or exponents that can be simplified. Or maybe the sequence converges to a certain value as n increases. But I need to find a specific term, a_2019, which is supposed to be 7^11.\n\nWait, 7^11 is a pretty big number. Maybe the sequence grows exponentially or something. But I'm not sure. Maybe I can look for a pattern in the exponents.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I take the logarithm of a_n. Maybe that will help me see a pattern. If I let b_n = log(a_n), then the recursive formula becomes b_n = log(n / (n-1)) + (a_{n-1} / a_{n-2}) * log(n / (n-1)). Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express a_n as (n / (n-1)) raised to some power, and see if that power follows a pattern. For example, a_3 = 9 = (3/2)^2, since 3/2 is 1.5, and 1.5 squared is 2.25, which is not 9. Wait, that doesn't work.\n\nMaybe a_3 = 3^2, which is 9, and a_4 = (4/3)^ (a_3 / a_2) = (", "Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The problem involves several angles: 45°, 60°, 75°, and 96°. It seems like there's some relationship between these angles that I need to uncover to prove that the measure of angle \\( m\\angle p \\) is indeed 96°.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's given and what's being asked. The angles 45°, 60°, and 75° are provided, and I'm supposed to use these to show that another angle, \\( m\\angle p \\), is 96°. I'm not entirely sure how these angles are related, but I'm guessing that they might be angles in a triangle or perhaps angles formed by intersecting lines.\n\nI think a good starting point would be to consider if these angles are part of a triangle. If I have a triangle with angles 45°, 60°, and 75°, I can check if their sum equals 180°, which is a fundamental property of triangles. Let's see: 45 + 60 + 75 equals 180°. Wait, that adds up perfectly to 180°, which means these could indeed be the angles of a triangle.\n\nBut how does this help me find \\( m\\angle p \\)? Maybe \\( m\\angle p \\) is an exterior angle of this triangle. I recall that an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. So, if I consider one of the angles in the triangle as an exterior angle, it should be equal to the sum of the other two.\n\nLet's test this idea. If I take 96° as the exterior angle, then the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles should be 96°. But in my triangle, the interior angles are 45°, 60°, and 75°, and their sum is 180°, which doesn't directly relate to 96°. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.\n\nPerhaps \\( m\\angle p \\) isn't an exterior angle but some other type of angle related to the triangle. Maybe it's formed by extending one of the sides or by some intersecting lines. I need to visualize this. If I draw the triangle with angles 45°, 60°, and 75°, and then extend one of its sides, creating an exterior angle, I can see if that exterior angle is 96°.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( m\\angle p \\) is part of a quadrilateral or another geometric figure involving these angles. If I consider a quadrilateral, the sum of its interior angles should be 360°. Let's see: 45° + 60° + 75° + 96° equals 276°, which is less than 360°, so that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, maybe \\( m\\angle p \\) is formed by two intersecting lines, creating vertical angles or supplementary angles. If two lines intersect, the opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180°. If I assume that \\( m\\angle p \\) is one of these angles, perhaps it's supplementary to one of the given angles.\n\nLet's try that. If \\( m\\angle p \\) is supplementary to 84°, then \\( m\\angle p \\) would be 96°, since 84° + 96° = 180°. But where would 84° come from? It doesn't seem to be one of the given angles. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the properties of parallel lines. If I have two parallel lines cut by a transversal, the corresponding angles are equal, and the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Maybe \\( m\\angle p \\) is one of these angles, and by using the given angles, I can find its measure.\n\nBut without a clear diagram, it's hard to apply these properties directly. I think I need to sketch a diagram based on the given angles and see how \\( m\\angle p \\) fits into it. Let's try that.\n\n[Sketching a diagram where a transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating angles of 45°, 60°, and 75°, and \\( m\\angle p \\) is one of the angles formed.]\n\nFrom the diagram, I can see that \\( m\\angle p \\) is an exterior angle on one side", "Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to finish the proof. Let me try to understand what's going on. The problem states that if a + h is greater than b + k, and also a + h equals b + k, then it must be that a equals b and h equals k. Hmm, that seems a bit contradictory at first glance because if a + h is both greater than and equal to b + k, that doesn't make sense unless both a and h are equal to b and k, respectively.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, we have two conditions: a + h > b + k and a + h = b + k. Wait, that's impossible because a number can't be both greater than and equal to another number at the same time. So, maybe there's a typo or something missing in the problem statement. Maybe it's supposed to be a + h > b + k and a + h = b + k under certain conditions, or perhaps it's a different relationship altogether.\n\nAssuming that the problem is correctly stated, and there's no typo, then the conclusion that a = b and h = k must follow from these two conditions. But logically, if a + h is both greater than and equal to b + k, that can only happen if a + h is exactly equal to b + k, which would mean that a = b and h = k. So, maybe the first condition is redundant, or perhaps it's meant to set up for a different part of the proof.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe the problem is part of a larger proof where a + h > b + k leads to certain inequalities, and then a + h = b + k is used to establish equality. In that case, the conclusion that a = b and h = k would follow from these steps.\n\nI'm also considering whether there are any constraints on the variables a, b, h, and k. If they're all positive numbers, or if there are some inequalities already established, that could affect the proof. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume that a, b, h, and k are real numbers.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether this problem is related to linear equations or systems of equations. If a + h = b + k, then rearranging terms gives a - b = k - h. If there's another equation involving these variables, it might help in solving for the variables individually.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is leading up to something like solving for variables in a system where a + h = b + k and another equation is given. In that case, having two equations would allow us to solve for the variables uniquely, leading to a = b and h = k.\n\nI'm also thinking about the possibility of using substitution or elimination methods to solve for the variables. If we have two equations, we can manipulate them to express one variable in terms of the others and then substitute back to find the values.\n\nBut going back to the original statement, it seems like the problem is asserting that if a + h is both greater than and equal to b + k, then a must equal b and h must equal k. But logically, if a + h is greater than b + k, then it can't be equal to it unless both a and h are equal to b and k, respectively.\n\nMaybe the problem is trying to emphasize that for the equality to hold, the individual terms must be equal. That is, a must equal b and h must equal k for their sum to be equal. This could be a way to highlight the importance of equality in sums.\n\nI'm also considering whether there are any edge cases or special scenarios where this might not hold. For example, if a, b, h, and k are not real numbers, or if they're complex numbers, the behavior might be different. But again, since the problem doesn't specify, I'll stick to real numbers.\n\nAnother thought is whether this problem is related to algebraic identities or properties, like the uniqueness of solutions in linear equations. If we have a system where a + h = b + k and another equation, the solution would be unique if the system is consistent and independent.\n\nI'm also thinking about the possibility of using proof by contradiction. Suppose a + h > b + k and a + h = b + k. Then, combining these two statements leads to a contradiction, implying that our initial assumption is false, and thus a = b and h = k must hold.\n\nBut wait, if a + h is both greater than and equal to b + k, that's a contradiction unless a + h equals b + k, which would mean a = b and h = k. So, maybe the problem is trying to lead us to recognize that the only way for a + h to be both greater than and equal to b +", "Alright, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It looks like it's about logarithms and exponents, which I remember from my algebra class, but I'm not entirely confident about all the properties. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are these four expressions:\n\n1. \\( a(x - y) = ax - ay \\)\n2. \\( a^{x - y} = \\frac{a^x}{a^y} \\)\n3. \\( \\log(x - y) = \\log x - \\log y \\)\n4. \\( x - y > 0 \\)\n\nAnd I need to prove that all these statements are true given that \\( a > 0 \\), \\( x > 0 \\), and \\( y > 0 \\).\n\nOkay, starting with the first one: \\( a(x - y) = ax - ay \\). This looks like the distributive property, which I think says that multiplying a number by a difference is the same as multiplying it by each term and then subtracting. So, \\( a(x - y) \\) should indeed equal \\( ax - ay \\). That makes sense, and I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be true as long as \\( a \\), \\( x \\), and \\( y \\) are real numbers, which they are here since they're all greater than zero.\n\nNext up is \\( a^{x - y} = \\frac{a^x}{a^y} \\). I recall that when you subtract exponents with the same base, it's like dividing the two exponents. So, \\( a^{x - y} \\) should be the same as \\( \\frac{a^x}{a^y} \\). I think this is a standard exponent rule, but maybe I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's see, if I have \\( a^x \\) divided by \\( a^y \\), that's \\( a^{x - y} \\), right? Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the third statement: \\( \\log(x - y) = \\log x - \\log y \\). Hmm, this one feels a bit trickier. I know that logarithms have certain properties, like \\( \\log(ab) = \\log a + \\log b \\), but I'm not sure about subtraction. I think there's a rule for that too, but I might be mixing it up. Let me think. If I have \\( \\log \\left( \\frac{x}{y} \\right) \\), that's equal to \\( \\log x - \\log y \\). Wait, that's similar to the second statement, but with division instead of subtraction. So, is \\( \\log(x - y) \\) equal to \\( \\log x - \\log y \\)? That doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm confusing the properties.\n\nLet me look this up to confirm. Okay, I see that \\( \\log \\left( \\frac{x}{y} \\right) = \\log x - \\log y \\), but \\( \\log(x - y) \\) isn't generally equal to \\( \\log x - \\log y \\). In fact, \\( \\log(x - y) \\) is only defined if \\( x - y > 0 \\), which is given here by the fourth statement. But the equality \\( \\log(x - y) = \\log x - \\log y \\) doesn't hold because logarithms don't distribute over subtraction like they do over multiplication or division. So, I think there might be a mistake in the third statement. Maybe it's supposed to be \\( \\log \\left( \\frac{x}{y} \\right) = \\log x - \\log y \\) instead?\n\nBut the problem says \\( \\log(x - y) = \\log x - \\log y \\), so I need to either prove that it's true or figure out why it's not. Given that \\( x - y > 0 \\), the left side is defined, but the right side is \\( \\log x - \\log y \\), which is \\( \\log \\left( \\frac{x}{y} \\right) \\). So, unless \\( x - y = \\frac{x}{y} \\), which would only be true for specific values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the equality doesn't hold in general. Therefore, I think the third statement might be incorrect as given.\n\nMoving on to the fourth statement: \\( x - y > 0 \\). This is given, so it's already true by the problem's conditions. I don't need to prove it; it's just a premise.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the first two statements seem to be correct based on the properties of arithmetic and", 'Alright, so I\'ve got this math problem here that I need to solve. It says, "Prove that if \\( d^2 / 2 = 40 \\), then \\( d^2 = 80 \\)." Hmm, at first glance, it seems pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand every step clearly.\n\nOkay, so starting with the given equation: \\( \\frac{d^2}{2} = 40 \\). I need to find \\( d^2 \\) and show that it equals 80. That seems simple enough, but I want to think about why this works. Maybe I should start by isolating \\( d^2 \\) on one side of the equation.\n\nSo, if I have \\( \\frac{d^2}{2} = 40 \\), to get \\( d^2 \\) by itself, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 2. That should cancel out the denominator on the left side. Let\'s see: \\( 2 \\times \\frac{d^2}{2} = 2 \\times 40 \\). On the left side, the 2 in the numerator and the 2 in the denominator cancel each other out, leaving just \\( d^2 \\). On the right side, \\( 2 \\times 40 \\) is 80. So, \\( d^2 = 80 \\). That seems to be the solution.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check to make sure I didn\'t miss anything. Sometimes in math, things that seem simple can have hidden gotchas. Let\'s verify my steps again. Starting with \\( \\frac{d^2}{2} = 40 \\), multiplying both sides by 2 gives \\( d^2 = 80 \\). Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe I could think about it in terms of proportions or ratios. If \\( \\frac{d^2}{2} = 40 \\), then \\( d^2 \\) is twice as much as 40. So, doubling 40 gives me 80, which is \\( d^2 \\). That matches what I got before.\n\nI guess another way to look at it is by substitution. If I let \\( x = d^2 \\), then the equation becomes \\( \\frac{x}{2} = 40 \\). Solving for \\( x \\), I multiply both sides by 2, getting \\( x = 80 \\). Since \\( x = d^2 \\), that means \\( d^2 = 80 \\). Consistent again.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there are any special cases or if \\( d \\) could be negative. Well, \\( d^2 \\) is always positive or zero, so \\( d \\) could be either positive or negative, but since we\'re dealing with \\( d^2 \\), the sign of \\( d \\) doesn\'t affect the outcome. So, \\( d^2 = 80 \\) holds true regardless of whether \\( d \\) is positive or negative.\n\nI also wonder if there\'s a geometric interpretation of this equation. If \\( d^2 \\) represents the area of a square with side length \\( d \\), then \\( \\frac{d^2}{2} = 40 \\) would mean that half the area of the square is 40. Therefore, the full area \\( d^2 \\) would be 80. That makes sense.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? Maybe units or dimensions, but since the problem doesn\'t specify any, I think it\'s safe to assume we\'re working with pure numbers.\n\nLet me summarize my thought process: Starting with \\( \\frac{d^2}{2} = 40 \\), I multiplied both sides by 2 to isolate \\( d^2 \\), resulting in \\( d^2 = 80 \\). I verified this by considering different approaches—direct multiplication, substitution, and even a geometric interpretation—and all led to the same conclusion. I also thought about the implications of \\( d \\) being positive or negative, but since we\'re dealing with \\( d^2 \\), the sign doesn\'t matter. Everything checks out, so I\'m confident that \\( d^2 = 80 \\) is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let\'s break this down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Start with the given equation**\nWe are given the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2}{2} = 40\n\\]\nOur goal is to solve for \\( d^2 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Isolate \\( d^2 \\)**\nTo isolate \\( d^2 \\), we need to eliminate the denominator. We can do', "Alright, so I've got this equation here: 12 times 60 over 100 times x equals 60 times 40 over 100 times 12. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to break it down and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, I see that both sides of the equation have similar numbers: 12, 60, and 40, all multiplied by 100. Maybe there's a pattern or a simplification I can use here. I'm thinking that perhaps I can simplify the equation by canceling out some of these numbers to make it easier to solve for x.\n\nOkay, so let's write out the equation again to make it clearer:\n\n(12 * 60 / 100) * x = (60 * 40 / 100) * 12\n\nHmm, I notice that both sides have a multiplication by 12. Maybe I can divide both sides by 12 to simplify things. Let's try that:\n\n(12 * 60 / 100) * x / 12 = (60 * 40 / 100) * 12 / 12\n\nOn the left side, the 12 in the numerator and the 12 in the denominator cancel each other out, leaving me with:\n\n(60 / 100) * x = (60 * 40 / 100)\n\nOkay, that's a bit simpler. Now, I can see that both sides have a multiplication by 60 and 100. Maybe I can divide both sides by 60 to further simplify:\n\n(60 / 100) * x / 60 = (60 * 40 / 100) / 60\n\nOn the left side, the 60 in the numerator and the 60 in the denominator cancel out, leaving me with:\n\nx / 100 = (60 * 40 / 100) / 60\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that step. I think I might have made a mistake in dividing both sides by 60. Let me try that again.\n\nStarting from:\n\n(60 / 100) * x = (60 * 40 / 100)\n\nIf I divide both sides by 60, I should get:\n\n(60 / 100) * x / 60 = (60 * 40 / 100) / 60\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx / 100 = (60 * 40 / 100) / 60\n\nBut actually, dividing both sides by 60 should cancel out the 60 on the left side, leaving me with:\n\nx / 100 = (60 * 40 / 100) / 60\n\nHmm, that still seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let me think differently.\n\nWhat if I first simplify both sides of the equation separately before trying to solve for x? Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the left side:\n\n12 * 60 / 100 * x\n\nI can calculate 12 * 60 first, which is 720. So, it becomes:\n\n720 / 100 * x\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n7.2 * x\n\nOkay, that's simpler. Now, the right side:\n\n60 * 40 / 100 * 12\n\nFirst, 60 * 40 is 2400. So, it becomes:\n\n2400 / 100 * 12\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n24 * 12\n\nAnd 24 * 12 is 288.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\n7.2 * x = 288\n\nAlright, that's much easier to work with. Now, to solve for x, I just need to divide both sides by 7.2.\n\nSo:\n\nx = 288 / 7.2\n\nLet me do that division. 288 divided by 7.2.\n\nWell, 7.2 times 40 is 288, because 7.2 * 40 = 288.\n\nSo, x = 40.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Did I miss something? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I simplified", 'Alright, so I\'ve got this math problem here that I need to solve. It says, "Prove that if \\( abc = 0 \\), then \\( abc - acb = 0 \\)." Hmm, at first glance, it seems pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand what\'s being asked and that I approach it correctly.\n\nOkay, so let\'s break it down. We\'re given that the product of three elements \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) is zero. That is, \\( abc = 0 \\). And we need to show that \\( abc - acb = 0 \\). So, essentially, we\'re being asked to prove that subtracting \\( acb \\) from \\( abc \\) gives zero, given that \\( abc \\) itself is zero.\n\nWait a minute, if \\( abc = 0 \\), then \\( abc - acb \\) would be \\( 0 - acb \\), which is just \\( -acb \\). But the problem says this should equal zero. So, does that mean \\( -acb = 0 \\)? That would imply that \\( acb = 0 \\) as well. But is that necessarily true?\n\nHold on, maybe I\'m missing something here. Perhaps there\'s more to the problem, or maybe there are certain conditions or properties of the elements \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) that I need to consider. For example, are these elements numbers, matrices, or something else? The notation \\( abc \\) could mean different things depending on the context.\n\nIf \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are numbers, then \\( abc = 0 \\) means that at least one of them is zero. In that case, \\( acb \\) would also be zero because multiplication is commutative for numbers. So, \\( abc - acb = 0 - 0 = 0 \\), which would make the statement true.\n\nBut what if \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are not numbers? What if they\'re matrices or operators where multiplication is not commutative? Then \\( abc \\) and \\( acb \\) could be different, even if \\( abc = 0 \\). In that case, \\( abc - acb \\) might not necessarily be zero.\n\nHmm, the problem doesn\'t specify the nature of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). Maybe I need to assume they\'re numbers or that multiplication is commutative. If I make that assumption, then the proof seems straightforward: since \\( abc = 0 \\), and multiplication is commutative, \\( acb = 0 \\), so \\( abc - acb = 0 - 0 = 0 \\).\n\nBut perhaps the problem is testing my understanding of algebraic structures where multiplication isn\'t necessarily commutative. In that case, I need to be careful. Maybe I should consider the possibility that \\( abc = 0 \\) doesn\'t imply \\( acb = 0 \\) unless certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, but the problem specifically asks to prove \\( abc - acb = 0 \\) given \\( abc = 0 \\). So, maybe regardless of the commutativity of multiplication, if \\( abc = 0 \\), then \\( abc - acb = 0 \\). But that doesn\'t seem right in general.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are matrices. Let\'s say \\( a \\) is a 2x2 matrix with a 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere, \\( b \\) is a similar matrix, and \\( c \\) is the identity matrix. Then \\( abc \\) might be zero, but \\( acb \\) could be different.\n\nActually, in matrix multiplication, \\( abc \\) and \\( acb \\) can be different unless the matrices commute. So, if \\( abc = 0 \\), it doesn\'t necessarily mean \\( acb = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( abc - acb \\) might not be zero.\n\nBut the problem says to prove \\( abc - acb = 0 \\) given \\( abc = 0 \\). Maybe there\'s a specific context or additional condition that I\'m missing. Perhaps the problem is within a commutative ring or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler than I\'m making it out to be. Maybe it\'s just about rearranging terms in a commutative setting. If \\( abc = 0 \\), and multiplication is commutative, then \\( acb = 0 \\), so \\( abc - acb = 0 - 0 = 0 \\).\n\nI think I need to clarify the context. If \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c', "Alright, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It looks a bit complicated at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step. The problem is about finding all pairs of positive integers (a, b) that satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. The sum of a/b and (14b)/(9a) is between 0 and 30, inclusive.\n2. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b is 1.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what these conditions mean and how to approach finding such pairs (a, b). Let's start by looking at the first condition: a/b + (14b)/(9a) ∈ [0, 30]. Since a and b are positive integers, both a/b and (14b)/(9a) are positive, so the sum being between 0 and 30 makes sense.\n\nI think a good starting point would be to simplify the expression a/b + (14b)/(9a). Maybe I can combine these two fractions into a single fraction to make it easier to analyze. To do that, I'll need a common denominator, which would be 9ab. So, let's rewrite both terms with this denominator:\n\na/b = (9a^2)/(9ab)\n(14b)/(9a) = (14b^2)/(9ab)\n\nNow, adding these two fractions together:\n\n(9a^2 + 14b^2)/(9ab) ∈ [0, 30]\n\nSince a and b are positive, the denominator 9ab is always positive, so the sign of the entire expression depends on the numerator. But since both a and b are positive, the numerator 9a^2 + 14b^2 is always positive, so the sum is always positive, which aligns with the first part of the interval [0, 30].\n\nNow, I need to ensure that this sum is less than or equal to 30:\n\n(9a^2 + 14b^2)/(9ab) ≤ 30\n\nTo simplify this inequality, I'll multiply both sides by 9ab (which is positive, so the inequality direction remains the same):\n\n9a^2 + 14b^2 ≤ 270ab\n\nNow, I'll rearrange the terms to bring everything to one side:\n\n9a^2 - 270ab + 14b^2 ≤ 0\n\nThis looks like a quadratic inequality in terms of a. Maybe I can treat b as a constant and solve for a. Let's rewrite the inequality:\n\n9a^2 - 270ab + 14b^2 ≤ 0\n\nDividing the entire inequality by b^2 (since b is positive, this is allowed without changing the inequality direction):\n\n9(a/b)^2 - 270(a/b) + 14 ≤ 0\n\nLet me set x = a/b, which is a positive real number since a and b are positive integers. Substituting x into the inequality:\n\n9x^2 - 270x + 14 ≤ 0\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic inequality for x. First, let's find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation:\n\n9x^2 - 270x + 14 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [270 ± sqrt(270^2 - 4*9*14)] / (2*9)\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\nD = 270^2 - 4*9*14 = 72900 - 504 = 72396\n\nNow, sqrt(72396) is approximately 269.07.\n\nSo, the roots are:\n\nx = [270 ± 269.07] / 18\n\nCalculating the two roots:\n\nx1 = (270 + 269.07) / 18 ≈ 539.07 / 18 ≈ 29.94\nx2 = (270 - 269.07) / 18 ≈ 0.93 / 18 ≈ 0.0517\n\nSo, the quadratic expression 9x^2 - 270x + 14 is less than or equal to zero between the roots x2 and x1. That is, for x in [0.0517, 29.94].\n\nBut since x = a/b is a positive rational number (because a and b are positive integers),", 'Alright, so I\'m trying to understand this problem. It says that for any positive integer \\( a \\), if \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers such that \\( x^2 > a \\) and \\( y^2 - a = x \\), then \\( x \\) must be a perfect square. Hmm, okay, let\'s break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what\'s being asked. We have two equations: \\( y^2 - a = x \\) and \\( x^2 > a \\). And we need to show that under these conditions, \\( x \\) is a perfect square. So, \\( x \\) is some positive integer greater than the square root of \\( a \\), and it\'s equal to \\( y^2 - a \\).\n\nI think I should start by expressing \\( a \\) in terms of \\( y \\) and \\( x \\). From the first equation, \\( a = y^2 - x \\). Now, since \\( x^2 > a \\), substituting \\( a \\) gives \\( x^2 > y^2 - x \\). Let\'s rearrange that: \\( x^2 + x > y^2 \\).\n\nHmm, not sure if that\'s helpful yet. Maybe I should think about the relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Since \\( x = y^2 - a \\), and \\( a \\) is positive, \\( y^2 \\) must be greater than \\( x \\). So, \\( y^2 > x \\).\n\nWait, but \\( x \\) is also greater than \\( \\sqrt{a} \\), so \\( x > \\sqrt{a} \\). Combining these, \\( y^2 > x > \\sqrt{a} \\). I\'m not sure if that\'s leading me anywhere.\n\nMaybe I should try some small values to see if I can spot a pattern. Let\'s pick \\( a = 1 \\). Then, \\( x^2 > 1 \\), so \\( x \\geq 2 \\). And \\( y^2 - 1 = x \\). So, \\( y^2 = x + 1 \\). If \\( x = 2 \\), then \\( y^2 = 3 \\), which isn\'t a perfect square. Hmm, that\'s a problem. Did I misunderstand the problem?\n\nWait, the problem says \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers, but in this case, \\( y \\) isn\'t an integer. Maybe \\( a = 1 \\) isn\'t a valid case. Let\'s try \\( a = 2 \\). Then \\( x^2 > 2 \\), so \\( x \\geq 2 \\). And \\( y^2 - 2 = x \\). If \\( x = 2 \\), then \\( y^2 = 4 \\), so \\( y = 2 \\). That works, and \\( x = 2 \\) is not a perfect square. Wait, but the problem says \\( x \\) must be a perfect square. This contradicts my earlier assumption.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again. It says, "for any positive integer \\( a \\), if \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers such that \\( x^2 > a \\) and \\( y^2 - a = x \\), then \\( x \\) is a perfect square." But in my example with \\( a = 2 \\), \\( x = 2 \\) satisfies \\( x^2 > 2 \\) and \\( y^2 - 2 = 2 \\) with \\( y = 2 \\), but \\( x = 2 \\) is not a perfect square. So, either I\'m misunderstanding the problem or there\'s a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a condition I\'m missing. Perhaps \\( a \\) is supposed to be a perfect square itself. Let\'s try \\( a = 4 \\). Then \\( x^2 > 4 \\), so \\( x \\geq 3 \\). And \\( y^2 - 4 = x \\). If \\( x = 3 \\), then \\( y^2 = 7 \\), which isn\'t a perfect square. If \\( x = 4 \\), \\( y^2 = 8 \\), still not a perfect square. If \\( x = 5 \\), \\( y^2 = 9 \\), so \\( y = 3 \\). Here, \\( x = 5 \\) is not a perfect square, but \\( y = 3 \\) is. This seems to contradict the statement again.\n\nI\'m getting confused. Maybe the problem is to show that \\( y \\) is a perfect square, not \\( x \\). Let']
